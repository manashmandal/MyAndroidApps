							<p>Since the fourth edition ofDigital Design, the commercial availability of devices using
		digital technology to receive, manipulate, and transmit information seems to have
		exploded. Cell phones and handheld devices of various kinds offer new, competing
		features almost daily. Underneath the attractive graphical user interface of all of these
		devices sits a digital system that processes data in a binary format. The theoretical
		foundations of these systems have not changed much; indeed, one could argue that
		the stability of the core theory, coupled with modern design tools, has promoted the
		widespread response of manufacturers to the opportunities of the marketplace. Consequently, our refinement of our text has been guided by the need to equip our graduates with a solid understanding of digital machines and to introduce them to the
		methodology of modern design.
		 This edition ofDigital Design builds on the previous four editions, and the feedback
		of the team of reviewers who helped set a direction for our presentation. The focus of
		the text has been sharpened to more closely reflect the content of a foundation course
		in digital design and the mainstream technology of today’s digital systems: CMOS
		circuits. The intended audience is broad, embracing students of computer science, computer engineering, and electrical engineering. The key elements that the book focuses
		include (1) Boolean logic, (2) logic gates used by designers, (3) synchronous finite state
		machines, and (4) datapath controller design—all from a perspective of designing digital systems. This focus led to elimination of material more suited for a course in electronics. So the reader will not find here content for asynchronous machines or
		descriptions of bipolar transistors. Additionally, the widespread availability of web‐
		based ancillary material prompted us to limit our discussion of field programmable
		gate arrays (FPGAs) to an introduction of devices offered by only one manufacturer,
		rather than two. Today’s designers rely heavily on hardware description languages</p>
